# What's this about?

The purpose of this blog will be to tackle some real-life problems I have come across. 

# How is will the blog be structured?

By rule of thumbs, every blog post will be cut down to 5 to 10 minutes reading time.   

Therefore, often a specific topic will be covered by a series of posts.
